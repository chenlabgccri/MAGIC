% MATLAB tool for modulated gene/gene set interaction (MAGIC) analysis
% 
% 
% MAGIC(DATA,GROUP,BONF,EQU_SAM_SIZE,P_CUTOFF,MOD_SCORE_CUTOFF,OUTPUT_FILENAME)
% identifies differentially correlated gene (or gene set) pairs modulated
% by states of a modulator; i.e., pair of genes that is correlated
% specifically in one state of the modulator (M). All possible combinations
% of genes deposited in DATA are tested. Take pair of gene i and j for
% example, correlation coefficients of gene i and j are separately
% calculated in samples with M=1 and samples with M=0. The correlation
% coefficients are Fisher transformed to a sample-size-free domain and
% tested for significance of their difference in the absolute manner (the
% modulation test). To ensure biologically meaningful change between the
% correlation coefficients, inverse Fisher transformation is utilized to
% convert the Fisher transformed coefficients back to the domain with a
% user-defined equivalent sample size. The modulation score measures the
% difference of transformed correlation coefficients. Gene (or gene set)
% pairs that meet the criteria on p-value from modulation test and
% modulation score are defined as modulated interaction pairs. The MAGIC
% tool outputs three matrices: modulation p-values, modulation scores, and
% adjacency matrix of the modulated interaction network, as well as a .txt
% file that can be used to generate the modulated interaction network by
% the Cytoscape software.
% 
% 
% Description of the input parameters:
% 
% DATA is a K-by-N numeric matrix (in double precision), which contains the
% expression profiles of K genes (or enrichment scores of K gene sets) in N
% samples. DATA should not contain NaNs.
% 
% GROUP is an N-length numeric vector that defines binary states of the
% modulator in N samples. GROUP can contain only 0s and 1s.
% 
% BONF is set as 1 to perform Bonferroni correction to the number of
% testing (nchoosek(K,2)). To analyze raw p-values, BONF should be set to
% 0. Suggested setting: 1
% 
% EQU_SAM_SIZE is a numeric value denoting user-assigned sample size at
% which correlation coefficients from two sample sizes (i.e., number of
% samples with M=1 and M=0) are compared; that is, the modulation scores
% are calculated at the sample size of EQU_SAM_SIZE. Suggested setting:
% average of number of samples with M=1 and M=0
% 
% P_CUTOFF is the threshold on raw (or Bonferroni corrected, when BONF = 1)
% p-value to define "statistically" significant modulated interaction.
% Suggested setting: 0.05
% 
% MOD_SCORE_CUTOFF is the threshold on modulation score to define
% "biologically" significant modulated interaction. MOD_SCORE_CUTOFF must
% be a positive numeric value. Suggested setting: 0.6
% 
% OUTPUT_FILENAME is a string specifying a filename for the output .txt
% file. If set as 'NA', no output txt file will be generated.
% 
% 
% Description of the outputs:
% 
% P1 is a K-by-K symmetric matrix, with elements of p-value from the
% modulation test. Significant P1(i,j) (typically < 0.05) means that genes
% i and j are strongly (either positively or negatively) correlated
% specifically in M=1 samples.
% 
% P0 is a K-by-K symmetric matrix, denoting the significance of strong
% correlation specifically in M=0 samples.
% 
% MOD_SCORE is a K-by-K symmetric matrix of modulation scores. Larger
% positive elements have stronger correlation in M=1 samples compared to
% M=0.
% 
% ADJ_MAT is a K-by-K symmetric adjacency matrix, of which a non-zero
% element ADJ_MAT(i,j) denotes a modulated interaction pair of i and j
% (i.e., the i-j edge in the modulated interaction network.
% 
% When output_filename is specified with any string except for 'NA', a
% Cytoscape compatible 'output_filename.txt' will be generated. The .txt
% file can be imported to Cytoscape for construction, visualization, and
% analyses of the modulated interaction network.
